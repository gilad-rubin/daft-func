# Conversation Summary: Advanced Caching for `pipefunc`

This conversation details the design of an advanced, dependency-aware incremental caching system tailored for your `pipefunc` pipeline. The primary goal was to overcome the limitations of `pipefunc`'s default caching (which is based only on root inputs) and implement a more granular, DAG-aware strategy.

### The Core Problem

Your pipeline (e.g., for `pylate` indexing) involves expensive, sequential steps like `load_corpus` -> `encode_corpus` -> `build_index`. You noted two major issues:

1. **`pipefunc`'s Default Cache:** The built-in caching mechanism bases its keys *only on the root inputs* (`root_args`) of the *entire pipeline*. It doesn't intelligently track changes in intermediate dependencies.
2. **Expensive Outputs:** Hashing the *outputs* of nodes (e.g., a multi-gigabyte embedding matrix or a complete index) to check for changes is computationally prohibitive and undesirable.

### Our Solution: Dependency-Aware Signatures (No Output Hashing)

We designed a more intelligent caching system based on a key assumption: **"Same code + same inputs + same parent signatures = same output."**

Instead of hashing a node's *output*, we compute a lightweight **computation signature** for each node. This signature acts as a "fingerprint" of the *work* that was done, not the *result* of that work.

The signature is a hash of several components:
`sig(N) = H(code_hash + env_hash + inputs_hash + deps_hash)`

- **`code_hash`:** A hash of the function's source code.
- **`env_hash`:** A hash of external factors that affect the result (e.g., a model name, library versions, or a manually-bumped "salt" string).
- **`inputs_hash`:** A hash of the node's *direct* input values (e.g., simple parameters).
- **`deps_hash`:** A hash of the **signatures** of all its direct parent nodes.

### Execution Logic & Key Scenarios

We established that this system would be managed by a `MetaStore` (to save the signatures) and a `BlobStore` (to save the actual outputs, like your existing `DiskCache`).

When the pipeline runs, it checks each node in topological order:

1. It computes the node's *new signature* based on its current code, inputs, and the *actual signatures* of its parents from the last run (retrieved from the `MetaStore`).
2. **Cache Hit:** If this `new_signature` matches the `stored_signature` in the `MetaStore`, the node is skipped. Its output is loaded from the `BlobStore` *only if* another node actually needs it (lazy materialization).
3. **Cache Miss:** If the signatures don't match, the node is re-executed, its output is saved to the `BlobStore`, and its `new_signature` is updated in the `MetaStore`.

This design explicitly handles your key scenarios:

- **Scenario 1 (Downstream Change):**
    - **DAG:** `(a,b) -> foo -> bar(foo_out, c)`
    - **Change:** Only `c` changes.
    - **Result:** `sig(foo)` is a **hit**. `sig(bar)` is a **miss** (because its `inputs_hash` changed). `bar` is recomputed, but it uses the *cached output* of `foo`. `foo` is *not* re-run.
- **Scenario 2 (Full Hit & Lazy Loading):**
    - **Change:** `a, b, c` are all unchanged.
    - **Result:** `sig(bar)` is a **hit**. The cached `bar_output` is returned *without* recomputing `bar` and, crucially, *without even loading `foo_out` from the cache* (unless another node also needs it).
- **Scenario 3 (Upstream Change):**
    - **Change:** `a` changes.
    - **Result:** `sig(foo)` is a **miss**. `foo` is recomputed. This generates a new `sig(foo)`. Because `bar`'s `deps_hash` (which depends on `sig(foo)`) is now different, `sig(bar)` is also a **miss**, and `bar` is recomputed.

### Final Steps

To validate this design, we concluded by creating a **test suite** with 5 specific `pytest` examples (e.g., `test_downstream_only_change`, `test_full_cache_hit`, `test_upstream_change`) and provided **guidance for an LLM** on how to surgically integrate this logic into the existing `pipefunc` codebase.
